					<h2>COVID-19?</h2>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						A lot of people are going to say COVID-19. How many of you had eCommerce of some kind pre-COVID? Cool, leave your hands up. How many of you had given it serious thought pre-COVID? And how many of you have given it serious thought now?

						Yeah, so it's definitely changed the conversation. But here's the thing - eCommerce is going to be valuable for you anyway. So answer "Why eCommerce" as you start exploring options, and I'm going to go ahead and answer "Should eCommerce be a long-term pillar of my business" for you.

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						eCommerce already had a 10% share of retail sales, and we just jump-started that. eCommerce, in some way, shape, or form, is here for the long-run. 

						But you may be thinking, I'm a local business! I don't want to compete with big online brands! Let's look at the impact of eCommerce on local.

				<section id="way-not-place">
					<h2>A new place to buy</h2>
					<p>vs</p>
					<h2>A new <span class="font-style:italic;">way</span> to buy</h2>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						First off, keep in mind that your customers aren't looking for a new place to buy. They like the stuff they buy now and the place they get it from. 

						But COVID has created a need for a new way to buy. That necessity will eventually turn into comfort with shopping online, so you need to meet people there today and in the future. It will impact local, and you can respond.

				<section id="local">
					<h2>Impact on Local</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Does brick and mortar matter?</li>
						<li>Local must be part of your business model</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						- Some people are probably wondering "does brick and mortar matter anymore?"
						- We don't have a real answer, but there's a strong argument that specialty retail won't go anywhere, especially if local is part of your business model.
						- Can't sniff a candle online, can't be fitted for shoes or clothes online.
						- Your eCommerce presence may not expand that far. You may still be serving mostly local customers, but offering them a new way to purchase from you and spend money with you.
					</aside>

				<section id="your-advantage">
					<h2>Your Local Advantage</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Brand Loyalty</li>
						<li>High Engagement</li>
						<li>Same-Day Delivery</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						People aren't buying online because they like online retailers better. They're buying online in a COVID-19 world because it's safe, and tomorrow they'll still be buying online because they like the convenience. For your local audience, you can actually be more convenient than the big brands. 

						Brand loyalty is very strong. Create a valuable in-person experience first, follow it up with high engagement on social media, and give customers all the convenience of buying online plus local delivery and high-touch product support. You'll find you're better equipped to fulfill than a Target, Dick's, or LuluLemon. You're better equipped than Amazon to deliver for your target customer.

						People don't care if UPS delivers the package or who they paid to get it there. They just want it at their door as soon as possible.

						You've got a ton of options for getting your product to your customer as soon as possible, so figure out which works best for you. These platforms aren't just for restaurants! Anyone selling a physical product should get in on this.

						Depending on your business, there may be other distinct advantages you can create over big box by being local. You may have scheduled coffee deliveries to an office that people can join every day. Plan the purchase for them. You may explore the world of subscription boxes. Get creative. Because ultimately...

						If the answer for you is no, you're probably a serivce provider of some kind, so I'd bet you're already collecting payments remotely, either via invoicing software or good old-fashioned checks in the mail. But if not, you've got some really easy solutions available to you!

						You can simply link someone to your PayPal account from your website. You can use a third-party embeddable form service, generally a paid option, and there might even be something your existing site already supports. Plenty of WordPress plugins that will let you take payments,
